abc4d is a pipeline to preprocess and analyze whole-brain microscopy data (over time). You have identified your active cells and aligned them to an atlas and wonder "What next?", **abc4d** is the place where to start.

abc4d has functions for: 
1) quality control, 
2) preprocessing, and 
3) analyses from the macro- to micro- scale. 

The resources offered within the package are in alignment of the Allen Brain Reference Atlas. However, for most functions these can be easily substituted.


## Get started

You can install the released version of abc4d from [github](https://github.com/valeriabonapersona/abc4d) with:

``` r
#If you do not have devtools yet:
#install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("valeriabonapersona/abc4d")
```

All dependencies will be automatically downloaded.


## Tutorials
See 'Articles'.
